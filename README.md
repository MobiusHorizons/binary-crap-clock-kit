This is a fairly crap clock kit made with CMOS logic, it is a fairly simple design and has the unique feature of being both difficult to read and difficult to set the time! Consider it a curiosity rather than a real timepiece, I cannot make any absolute guarantees about its accuracy but it is fairly good.

I made it as a challenge to myself more than anything else, an exercise in learning about CMOS logic and making my first kit.

It runs down to about 2.7-3v (0.5mA with LEDs and ~6ÂµA without the LEDs running) and up to 6v and consumes very little current running at lower voltages. In fact, you could run it for years on 2AA batteries with the LEDs disabled. At 3v the LEDs are fairly dim but at 5v they will dazzle you, choose your poison.

I haven't included extensive instructions, it should be fairly self-explanatory... that said, I mess stuff up all the time. So with that in mind, here is a video of me building it. I realise this could be a bit of a slog to watch so feel free to just wing it.
